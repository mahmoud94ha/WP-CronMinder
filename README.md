WordPress cron is a powerful feature that allows you to schedule automated tasks within your WordPress website. In the context of posting articles from XML files, you can utilize WordPress cron to regularly import XML data and automatically create new posts based on the content of those files.

With the XML data as a source, you can extract relevant information such as article titles, content, categories, filters, and tags. By leveraging WordPress cron, you can set up a scheduled task to run at specified intervals, such as daily or hourly, to fetch the XML data and process it.

Once the XML data is retrieved, you can programmatically parse and extract the desired article details. This includes extracting categories, filters, and tags associated with each article. These details play a crucial role in organizing and categorizing the imported content within your WordPress site.
